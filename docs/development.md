# Development reference

Use Node.js 22 or newer. The project uses TypeScript, esbuild and Manifest V3, without a UI framework in the extension runtime.

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:native
npm run build
```

Load `dist` as an unpacked extension. `npm run demo` serves a writing room for testing, while the installed extension provides checking. The included extension-page writing room also works without a server.

## Local checking

English uses Harper 2.13.0 and Hunspell vocabulary. German and Romanian use an unmodified LingoTweaker 0.2.8 WebAssembly binary and one language pack each, with LanguageTool-derived rules and dictionaries. Language detection uses ELD locally.

German and Romanian rule compilation runs in a dedicated worker owned by an offscreen document, keeping the editor and extension UI responsive. After 60 seconds without a German or Romanian request, the worker terminates to release WASM memory. Its next request initializes it again. This engine uses more memory than the English engine; a cold check is slower than subsequent updates.

All engines and language resources ship inside the extension. No runtime code or dictionary is fetched from a CDN. The build verifies each pinned language pack checksum and extracts upstream license notices.

The old Java LanguageTool server files are retained for historical native compatibility. Current grammar checking does not use that server or its installer.

## Editing correctness

All browser/editor spans use UTF-16. The German and Romanian engines' UTF-8 byte spans must be converted before applying edits. Replacements verify the exact original text and editor version; stale results must not change a new draft.

Detected Draft.js editors receive edits through controlled paste/deletion handlers rather than direct DOM mutation. This avoids divergent DOM and editor state after translation. Keep typing, Backspace, select-all/delete and undo checks when changing this path.

## Optional AI helper

Chrome Native Messaging connects the extension to the local helper. The installer discovers official CLIs and registers the installed extension's specific origin. Text is passed through stdin, never interpolated into a shell command. The helper uses a temporary working directory, disables tools and user customizations for editing requests, and removes temporary files afterwards.

See [AI setup](ai-setup.md) for installation and [Privacy](privacy.md) for the data flow.

## Browser checks

Browser tests use temporary profiles. Set `QUILL_BROWSER=helium` to use an installed macOS Helium app; otherwise the scripts use Playwright Chromium.

```sh
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:editors
npm run test:feedback
QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:experience
QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:draft
QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:ux
QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:onboarding
QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:zero-install
```

`test:experience` uses an explicit deterministic CLI fixture to check the editing workflow. `test:zero-install` disables network access and native messaging while checking both languages. `test:rewrite`, `test:languages` and `test:ai` use installed, signed-in AI CLIs with synthetic text and consume normal provider usage.

To test an extracted Store package instead of `dist`:

```sh
GRAMMAI_EXTENSION_PATH=/absolute/path/to/extracted/package QUILL_BROWSER=helium npm run test:zero-install
GRAMMAI_EXTENSION_PATH=/absolute/path/to/extracted/package npm run test:feedback
```

`test:feedback` checks the real extension's entry points, in-place submission, success and error states, email fallback and appearance. The endpoint is intercepted inside the test; it never submits a public issue or sends an email. With no endpoint configured it checks the disabled-send fallback instead. To exercise submission, build with a mock HTTPS endpoint first:

```sh
GRAMMAI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT=https://feedback.grammai.test/v1/feedback npm run build
npm run test:feedback
```

Run against both that `dist` build and its extracted Store ZIP to verify different installation IDs. Never publish a package built with the test endpoint. Worker unit tests run with `npm test`. See [feedback deployment](feedback.md) for the production setup.
